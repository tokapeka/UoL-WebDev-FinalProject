                <p>
                    In 2018 we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program (MPNP) and the important contribution that immigration has made to the growth and vitality of our communities and our economy. Over the last two decades, the MPNP brought in more than 130,000 economic immigrants to Manitoba of whom more than 20% established themselves in regional communities throughout the province. For the sake of comparison, Manitoba received approximately 70,000 additional immigrants through federal programs during the same period of whom only 11% chose communities outside of Winnipeg
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, the transformative impact of the MPNP is a story shared across many municipalities including my own community of Steinbach. In 1996, Steinbach had a population of 8,478 people which has now almost doubled, mostly due to the arrival of new immigrants. When I was growing up, I would have needed to get on a plane to travel the world. Today, my son only has to go to his local school to experience an incredible diversity of people and cultures. And the same story can be told for communities like Winkler and the RM of Stanley, long recognized as one of Canada's fastest growing municipalities. Winkler's population had doubled since 1996 and Morden has seen its population grow by welcoming, on average, 50 families a year from 2013 to 2018. Neepawa grew from 3,100 residents to over 4,300 in a three-year period, and now has over 4,600 residents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These success stories have been built on strong partnerships between community and business leaders in local chambers of commerce and economic development offices, local employers, settlement agencies, our schools and colleges, and the MPNP. Companies like Maple Leaf and Hylife, as well as manufacturers and other businesses across Manitoba have participated in MPNP strategic recruitment initiatives to interview and hire immigrant skilled workers overseas and/or offer employment opportunities to the families and friends those workers encouraged to follow them to a new life in Canada.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our success in attracting newcomers has been sustained by strong regional economies where unemployment rates have been as low as 3.1%, and immigration has in turn contributed to the labour force growth and business expansion of rural manufacturing and other industries. This success is also reflected in our ability to retain these newcomer families at a rate that has remained consistently between 87 and 90%. But these statistical facts are brought much closer to home for all of those communities that have been able to keep their schools open and in many cases even add additional schools and classrooms to keep up with their growing youth population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Manitoba's rural immigration success story is also recognized across Canada and some communities have hosted delegations from other Provinces and Ottawa interested in learning why we have succeeded where others continue to struggle. The federal government recently announced a new ‘rural immigration pilot' which essentially builds on Manitoba's best practices – partnerships with local business and economic development leaders, strong settlement planning and targeted recruitment to fit local needs – with the objective of replicating our success in northern Ontario and other jurisdictions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Manitoba, we are certainly not taking our immigration success story for granted. That is why one of our government's earliest public commitments in 2016 was to strengthen and renew the MPNP by eliminating the application backlog and improving the labour market outcomes of our nominees. In 2017, we successfully eliminated a backlog of close to 4000 applications, many with processing times of more than two years, to a new standard where every complete MPNP application is processed in less than six months. In 2018, we issued 5119 skilled worker nominations, the highest number in MPNP history. In addition, more than 78.6% of these nominees were already connected to a Manitoba employer – again, the highest number ever. Finally, 28.8% of our nominations were for 93 different communities outside of Winnipeg.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the weeks ahead, the MPNP will be rolling out a new rural immigration toolkit on the program website to help communities who are newer to the immigration process benefit from the proven best practices of their fellow municipalities who have already experienced the benefits of workforce and population growth. This toolkit will help communities to engage key business stakeholders and local leaders to begin planning to welcome newcomers and optimize their potential to contribute to local employment and business investment. It will also support community planners to develop recruitment strategies that leverage the MPNP and other immigration pathways to achieve local economic development objectives.
