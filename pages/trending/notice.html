                    These notices pertain to the various stages in the Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program (MPNP) application process: pre-application, application, and post-nomination.
                </p>
                <h2>Pre-Application</h2>
                <p>
                    Do not submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) if you do not currently meet all the eligibility criteria of the stream to which you are applying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you were laid-off due to COVID-19 and have since resumed working in Manitoba, you can count your months of work before and after your lay off towards your eligibility for the MPNP. For example, if you worked in Manitoba for five months on a temporary work permit, were laid off for two months and have resumed working again, you have to work for one more month to become eligible to submit an EOI to the MPNP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are in Manitoba on a temporary work permit and you have lost your job permanently due to COVID-19, you may look for new employment. You can count the time you have worked for your original company and the new company towards your eligibility for the MPNP. For example, if you worked in Manitoba for five months on a temporary work permit, were terminated from that job permanently due to COVID-19, and you found a new job, you have to work for one month to become eligible to submit an EOI to the MPNP. Be prepared to submit employment documentation from both employers, including proof that your termination was due to COVID-19, when you submit your application to the MPNP.
                </p>
                <h2>Application</h2>
                <p>
                    The MPNP will accept applications with missing documentation, given the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Please upload an explanation letter to support why specific mandatory documents are not included in your application at the time of submission. Please note that the MPNP may not be able to complete the assessment of your application until you submit all documentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have been laid off or your hours have been reduced, please obtain detailed documentation (letter, pay stubs, Record of Employment, etc.) from your employer to be included in your MPNP application so that future considerations can be made when processing your application.If you have been laid off and re-hired, please obtain a letter from your employer explaining your employment situation.
                </p>
                <h2>Post-nomination</h2>
                <p>
                    If your employment situation has changed as a result of COVID-19, please contact the MPNP by email as soon as possible at <b>immigratemanitoba@gov.mb.ca</b>. Include your MPNP file number in your email.
