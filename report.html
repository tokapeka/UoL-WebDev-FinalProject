                    Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I developed a website entitled Immigration to Manitoba (Manitoba is a Canadian Province). The description of my site is:  Immigration to Manitoba is a newsletter website that shares news on immigration, settling, education and work in Manitoba. A reliable source of information for those interested in starting a new life in this beautiful and vibrant Canadian Province!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to go with a news/newsletter style design that contains multiple articles on the main page arranged in a functional structure (based on the viewport size), that also has 4 main categories of articles/news: Immigration, Settlement, Education and Work. The website also has a Contact page.  
                </p>
                <br>

                    Inspiration: 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website (e.g. guest speakers, websites, artists, blogs).
                </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Currently, I work as a Policy Analyst at Immigration Division within the Government of Manitoba. What I noticed is that there is no single online resource that would provide up-to-date and reliable information on the 4 topics: Immigration, Settlement, Education and Work that would help newcomers finding out relevant information. So, I thought it would be an interesting idea to create a website focused on these 4 topics. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Prior to starting the Bachelor of Science Program, I took a 6 months long Bootcamp on Web Development. I really enjoyed and learned a lot, so I wanted to practice some of the skills I acquired there, and specifically create a website that allows users to change the Theme (dark to light and back), and also, practice some JavaScript skills
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        I plan to improve the website a bit more and add some additional functionality (mainly back-end/server side) and include this website into my Portfolio and showcase to potential employers. 
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>
                    Accessibility: 3 ways in which your site is accessible.
                </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The images on the website have extensive description of what they represent (alt=” … ”) so that people with visual impairments can still understand what is on each image. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        The website allows users to switch between dark and light themes/modes, which is helpful while browsing in low light/at night or for people with neurological impairments. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        The website uses large fonts for main titles and high color contrast colors, which allows people with visual impairments to still use it in an effective manner. 
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    Usability: 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site:
                </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Mobile Responsiveness - the website is fully responsive and can be viewed on different viewports and all the content size and layout adjust accordingly to ensure that all information is available and easy to locate.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Credibility of presented information - the news and articles used on the website all contain real life pictures and information relevant to specific content and real-life situations. Also, links to external resources were added as well, where applicable.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        The website has a clear and intuitive interface, allowing users to easily navigate to the required resources. There are links both at the top and bottom of each page, a sticky navigation bar that remains on top of page even when users scroll down through the content. This allows for fast and easy navigation. 
                    </li>

                    Learning: 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did you achieve that?
                </h3>
                 <p>
                    As mentioned previously, I do have extensive knowledge of Front-end Development, in particular, however, I wanted to practice some specific skills and learn new ones. Namely:
                 </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Implementing Javascript code that would allow users to change the website theme (color). There are multiple ways to achieve this, but after some research I ended up using an addEvenListener to append a child element to a parent element, and then   using if and else statements to verify which element is appended. Also, the state is being stored by the website, so that when it is refreshed, it maintains the user’s chosen option. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        How to create an interactive Contact form where the placeholders move above the input field. I consulted w3schools website and multiple youtube videos (of course I refactored the code to ensure it fits the color scheme and layout of my website), since these extra elements need to be explored outside of what the university is teaching. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Importing fonts and icons - I learned how to import specific Google Fonts (I did a bit of research on the website that shows how to select the specific font, import it into the CSS file or as a <link> in the html file. For icons I did research on remixicon.com and fontawesome.com and also learned on how to link the html file to the external resource and then use a specific icon in the div class. Very interesting!
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>
                    Evaluation I: What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful? Why?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Among the successful things I would mention that I did learn how to effectively use online resources not only for learning new things but also how to search for solutions when some piece of code doesn’t work as expected. This helped me design a responsive grid and also implement the theme change functionality. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, I’m quite happy that I was able to create an almost real website that could be put online (obviously I need to add server-side functionality so that user requests can be sent to the server or subscription request to be used for email dissemination). 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Evaluation II: What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things differently another time? 
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I think that I need to learn a bit more about structuring the pages and images in folders, so that when the website becomes more complex and contains more pages, the required resources can be easily accessible and modified. Obviously, the University course cannot teach each and every aspect, so I am looking forward to learning by myself the aspect of structuring the working folders and files for large websites. However, from my Bootcamp experience, for complex websites it makes more sense to create them in frameworks such as React or React Native because the logic behind the code allows for a more structured handling of resources.
